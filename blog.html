            <p>    Whether you’re a professional web developer or you’re just getting started,
                the benefits of a faster workflow can be fantastic. In this article,
                we’ll dive into how to set-up an optimal workflow using Visual Studio Code.
                Visual Studio Code comes with a lot of great features built-in, but add in
                the large (and growing) pool of extensions and you end up with thousands of
                ways to customise your experience.While this is one of VS Code’s core strengths,
                it can also be overwhelming — especially for newer users. This article intends
                to cut through the noise. In it, I’ll share the most powerful techniques
                I use every day to work as quickly and effectively as possible.
